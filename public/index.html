                RAGS - Residency ART in GARDENS initiative - strives to preserve and strengthen the long relationship
                between downtown art and green spaces by placing an artist in residence in each of the Lower East Side's
                community gardens.

                Visual Artists Rights Act (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Artists_Rights_Act">VARA</a>)
                gives
                artists full rights to work
                that is created or installed in any public space, the presence of newly-created art would put an extra
                roadblock in the way of politicians
                and developers eager to turn our downtown green spaces into residential or commercial buildings.
